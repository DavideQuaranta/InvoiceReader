# Invoice Reader
Takes pdf invoices from a folder and generates an excel file containing all the fields. Based on the ministerial template.

Requirements:
- install pdfplumber via pip install pdfplumber
- install os
- install pandas

To start the program type "python .\main.py" in your terminal.
When the program starts eventually it will ask to install the missing packages. You then only have to write the path to the desired folder.
